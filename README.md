# raincloudplots-workshops
<br>
<br>
Repository to register for the upcoming 'raincloudplots' workshops.
<br>
<br>
These workshops are part of our NWO 'Open Science' funded project: <a href="raincloudplots 2.0">https://www.nwo.nl/en/projects/203001011</a> by Rogier Kievit & Jordy van Langen. <br> <a href="https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15191.2">https://doi.org/10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15191.2</a>

<br>
With the workshops, we hope to educate & showcase 'raincloudplots' to the wider academic community.
We will host three online workshops in which we will present step-by-step tutorials for experts, who are already familiar with 'raincloudplots', but also to those who find using code (unnecessarily) daunting. The free workshops will entail plenary walk-throughs and smaller break-out-rooms.
<br>
<br>
The workshops will be organized on the following dates:
