## Our plan
With these workshops, we hope to educate & showcase 'raincloudplots' to the wider academic community.
We will host three online workshops in which we will present step-by-step tutorials for experts, who are already familiar with 'raincloudplots', but also to those who find using code (unnecessarily) daunting. The free workshops will entail plenary walk-throughs and smaller break-out-rooms.

## When? (all finished)
The workshops will take place on the following dates:
