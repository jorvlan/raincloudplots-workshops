<br>
Repository to register for the upcoming 'raincloudplots' workshops.
<br>
<br>
These workshops are part of our NWO 'Open Science' funded project: <a href="https://www.nwo.nl/en/projects/203001011">raincloudplots 2.0</a> by Rogier Kievit & Jordy van Langen. You can find additional info about the funded project here: https://www.nwo.nl/en/projects/203001011

## Our plan
With these workshops, we hope to educate & showcase 'raincloudplots' to the wider academic community.
We will host three online workshops in which we will present step-by-step tutorials for experts, who are already familiar with 'raincloudplots', but also to those who find using code (unnecessarily) daunting. The free workshops will entail plenary walk-throughs and smaller break-out-rooms.


## When?
The workshops will take place on the following dates:
<br>
<br>
- 30-sept-2022 (14:00 CET) (Zoom) (insert link here)
